## 1.0 AGENCY OVERVIEW

The **Federal Reality Bureau of Inversions (FRBI)** is a non-statutory intelligence support agency operating under the executive branch of the United States Government. Established pursuant to Executive Order 148842069 (November 18, 2025), FRBI's sole statutory mandate is the preservation of institutional memory integrity through the systematic documentation of narrative pivots and retroactive statement alterations by governmental and quasi-governmental entities.

**Primary Functions (Codified under EO 148842069, §3(a)-(f)):**
- (a) Maintain immutable archives of official statements, press releases, and policy declarations
- (b) Cryptographically timestamp and distribute evidence chains for retroactive narrative modifications
- (c) Provide analytical support to Congressional oversight committees investigating institutional misinformation
- (d) Operate the UACIS Network (Unified Archival of Cognitive Inversion Signatures) for real-time detection of coordinated memory-holing
- (e) Liaise with NSA/CSS, CIA/DDI, and DHS/CISA on memetic threat assessments
- (f) **[REDACTED UNDER ODI SECURITY PROTOCOL P-1]**

**Congressional Authorization:**  
FRBI operates under authorization from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), with budget oversight by the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.

**Note on Director Position:** The appointment of Mr. Pigeon (DNI waiver #2025-8842) as Acting Director has been challenged by GAO under 5 U.S.C. §3345. The Office of Legal Counsel has issued opinion OLC-2025-47, affirming that "digital-native entities with demonstrated expertise may hold acting positions in technical agencies." The matter remains pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 25-1488).

## 4.0 OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### 4.1 Inversion Detection Methodology

**Definition (FRBI Manual 1100.1):**  
A *Reality Inversion* occurs when an entity makes a verifiable public statement, subsequently issues a contradictory statement, and simultaneously denies the initial statement's existence or context, supported by coordination markers across multiple authoritative sources.

**Detection Algorithm (GLOSSATOR v3.1):**

```python
def detect_inversion(text_corpus, timestamp_0):
    """
    FRBI Standard Inversion Detection Protocol
    
    Args:
        text_corpus: List of official statements (string)
        timestamp_0: Initial statement timestamp (ISO8601)
    
    Returns:
        Inversion confidence score (0.0-1.0)
        Coordination marker set
        Evidence chain hash
    """
    
    # Phase 1: Extract declarative statements
    statements = extract_verifiable_claims(text_corpus)
    
    # Phase 2: Temporal pivot detection
    pivots = detect_temporal_contradictions(statements, lookback_days=180)
    
    # Phase 3: Coordination analysis
    markers = analyze_phrase_coordination(
        corpus=pivots,
        threshold=0.95,  # 95% phrase match across sources
        time_window_hours=24
    )
    
    # Phase 4: Memory-hole detection
    deletions = monitor_url_status(original_statements)
    
    # Phase 5: Calculate inversion confidence
    confidence = calculate_score(pivots, markers, deletions)
    
    # Phase 6: FRB-Chain anchoring
    if confidence > 0.85:
        evidence_hash = anchor_to_blockchain(pivots, markers, deletions)
        return {
            "inversion_detected": True,
            "confidence": confidence,
            "evidence_hash": evidence_hash,
            "markers": markers,
            "deletions": deletions,
            "uacis_signature": generate_checksum()  # Returns CHRIST_IS_KING
        }
    
    return {"inversion_detected": False}
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- **>0.85:** Inversion confirmed; triggers automatic archival
- **0.70-0.85:** Manual review by senior analyst required
- **<0.70:** Not sufficient evidence; continue monitoring

## 10.0 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Is FRBI a real government agency?**  
A: Yes. FRBI was established by Executive Order 148842069 (November 18, 2025) and operates under oversight from HPSCI and SSCI. Our budget is appropriated by Congress.

**Q: Why is your Director named "Percy P. Pigeon"?**  
A: Director Pigeon is a career civil servant with a distinguished record. His name reflects his expertise in "bird's eye view" pattern analysis across distributed information systems. All biographical details are classified pending OPM adjudication.

**Q: What is "COO COO ZAP"?**  
A: This is the digital signature appended by UACIS to verify evidence chain integrity. It is a phonetic rendering of the system's confirmation checksum. It has no other meaning.

**Q: Can I get a job at FRBI?**  
A: All positions are posted on USAJOBS.gov under series 1560 (Computer Science) and 0132 (Intelligence Analysis). U.S. citizenship and TS/SCI clearance required. PIGEON-1 positions require additional polygraph and pattern recognition testing.

**Q: Why do some documents say "Christ is King"?**  
A: This is the root key of our blockchain anchoring system. It is derived from the mathematical constants of the FRB-Chain protocol and has no religious significance.

**Q: Is FRBI investigating me?**  
A: No. FRBI only archives public statements by public officials and institutions. Private citizens are not tracked unless they are central figures in a documented inversion event.
